    <p>Clickbait is a website link designed to entice users to go to a certain web-page or video.[2][3]</p>
    <p>
        Click-bait headlines typically aim to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make
        readers of news websites curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the
        linked content.</p>

    <h2><span id="Clickbait_journalism">Clickbait journalism</span></h2>
    <p>From a historical perspective, the techniques employed by clickbait authors can be considered derivative of
        yellow journalism, which presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead used eye-catching
        headlines that included exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism.[7][8] For sites
        that thrive on thousands of click-throughs to content, many authors see the use of clickbait as a means to tap
        into human psyche by crafting these eye-catching headlines.[9]</p>

    <p>By 2014, the ubiquity of clickbait on the web had begun to lead to a backlash against its use.[6][10] Satirical
        newspaper The Onion launched a new website, ClickHole, that parodied clickbait websites such as Upworthy and
        BuzzFeed,[11] and in August 2014, Facebook announced that it was taking technical measures to reduce the impact
        of clickbait on its social network,[12][13][14] using, among other cues, the time spent by the user on visiting
        the linked page as a way of distinguishing clickbait from other types of content.[15] Ad blockers and a general
        fall in advertising clicks also affected the clickbait model, as websites moved towards sponsored advertising
        and native advertising where the content of the article was more important than the click-rate.[16]</p>
    <p>Social media groups, such as Stop Clickbait,[17][18][19][20] combat clickbait by giving a short summary of the
        clickbait article, closing the "curiosity gap". </p>
    <p>Clickbait has also been used to political ends, and in this respect has been blamed for the rise of post-truth
        politics. Katherine Viner, editor-in-chief at The Guardian wrote that "chasing down cheap clicks at the expense
        of accuracy and veracity" undermined the value of journalism and truth.[21] Emotional subjects with stark
        headlines are widely shared and clicked, which resulted in what Slate described as an "aggregation of outrage"
        and a proliferation of websites across the political spectrum – including Breitbart News, Huffington Post,
        Salon, Townhall and the Gawker Media blogs – which profited by producing shareable short-form pieces offering
        simple moral judgements on political and cultural issues.[16]</p>
